# GPU export

`@akari-video/gpu-export` is the GPU-direct H.264 export path for eligible AKARI Video projects.
It evaluates the shared frame engine sequentially, composites supported DOM-derived sprites on a
WebGL2 canvas, passes that canvas to `VideoFrame` and WebCodecs, and writes encoded Annex B samples
directly to MP4 with mp4box. Raw frame pixels are not transferred to Node or piped to ffmpeg.

## Eligibility

The GPU path accepts static HTML sprites, supported caption motion, declarative Three.js scenes,
and frame-engine layers. Karaoke and other word-level captions, emphasis words, dynamic HTML,
embedded contexts, external resources, and clip-path caption motion are not supported in v0.

`render-cut --engine auto` uses GPU export on macOS only when the complete project is eligible;
otherwise it uses OSR. Explicit `--engine gpu` fails closed and prints every ineligibility reason.

## Development

```sh
npm test
npm run assert-zero-readback
npm run bundle:frame-engine
npm run check:frame-engine-drift
```

The frame-engine bundle is generated. Do not edit `generated/frame-engine.js` directly.
Frame hashing is available only through the isolated verification module and cannot be combined
with the runtime readback trap.
